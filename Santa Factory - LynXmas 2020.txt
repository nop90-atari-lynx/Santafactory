LynXmas 2020 Game Jam - An Atari Lynx homebrew game by Nop90

Santa Factory is the legendary workshop where Santa Claus is 
said to make the toys and presents given out at Christmas. 
December is a busy month in this factory, elves have to pack
all the presents before the eve night.

In this game you play as an elf controlling a packing line.
You have a list of  wishes  and  you  have  to  combine  the 
desired toys according to it. You are allowed to  make  some
wrong packs (after all "do not look  a  gift  horse  in  the 
mouth"), but too many mistakes and Xmas could be ruined.

In the Puzzle mode you have a list of presents for every day
of December from 8th to 24th and you have to pack them in  a
limited amount of time. In the Arcade mode you play  in  the
last minutes before the eve night and have to pack  as  many
gifts as you can without mistakes. There is a time limit,but
at every good pack you make Santa gives you some  more  time
with his magic.
